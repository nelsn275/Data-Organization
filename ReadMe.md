# Overview

This is a project that gathers fruit and vegetable data from a public source and uses the data to perform conversions that could be useful

I decided to create this program because my wife who is a Food Science major often needs to know conversions between lbs of a certain food and cups. She also needs to know how much that will cost.

# Development Environment

I used both Apple Numbers and VsCode to write this project. 

I wrote this code in pyton because I am most familiar with this language
